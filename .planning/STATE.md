# State: Kaihom Agent v1

**Last Updated:** 2026-05-07
**Current Phase:** Phase 2 - Mock Kaihong Business API
**Current Status:** Phase 2 planned; ready for `$gsd-execute-phase 2`.

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md`

**Core value:** A business user can upload logistics documents from a phone, let the Agent pre-fill an order draft, answer only missing/uncertain fields, and save a reviewable draft.

## Current Focus

Execute the Mock Kaihong business API boundary. Phase 2 should simulate login/current-user, customers, dictionaries, recent orders, and local draft persistence without touching the real Kaihong Wing system.

## Important Context

- The real Kaihong Wing system is unavailable.
- Do not build real Java/Spring integration yet.
- Do not connect to any real company database.
- The first value loop is Mock-only: upload -> mock extraction -> clarification -> draft save.
- Planning docs are committed to git per user choice.
- GSD mode: YOLO, standard granularity, parallel execution, research/plan_check/verifier enabled.

## Next Action

Run:

```text
$gsd-execute-phase 2
```

## Recent Decisions

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|------|----------|--------|
| 2026-05-07 | Use Python FastAPI for v1 | Best fit for Mock Agent/OCR workflow and fast iteration. |
| 2026-05-07 | Mock Kaihong APIs first | No real Kaihong Wing access yet. |
| 2026-05-07 | Save drafts only | Avoid unsafe formal order automation. |
| 2026-05-07 | Mobile H5 first | Fastest route to phone-accessible demo. |
| 2026-05-07 | Phase 1 planned as one focused execution plan | Foundation work is small enough for one autonomous plan. |
| 2026-05-07 | Phase 1 established a FastAPI app factory, cached settings, `/health`, OpenAPI coverage, tests, and README commands | Provides the backend foundation for Mock Kaihong API work. |
| 2026-05-07 | Phase 2 planned Mock Kaihong endpoints under `/mock/kaihong` with local SQLite draft persistence | Gives later Agent phases a realistic business API boundary without real Kaihong access. |

## Open Questions

- What exact fields will Kaihong Wing require when real API docs become available?
- Which OCR/LLM provider will be acceptable for business documents?
- Will the final internal frontend be H5, Enterprise WeChat, or WeChat Mini Program?
- What data can legally/commercially leave the company network?
